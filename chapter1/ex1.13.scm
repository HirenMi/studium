;; Exercise 1.13: Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to Φ**n/√5, where Φ = (1 + √5)/2.
;; Hint: Let Φ = (1 - √5)/2. Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers
;; (see section 1.2.2) to prove that Fib(n) = (Φ**n - Φ**n)/√5.


; Huu? I don't remember anything about mathematical induction.
