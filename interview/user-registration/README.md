### 1. Create Registration Form

Imagine that you are part of a team that is creating a new library from scratch 
to capture user registration details and store them in a repository.

The library is intended to be consumed by different front-end applications (including web).

Requirements

- We need to capture and the following user details:
	- Username
	- PostCode
	- Email Address  

Please see the table below for the email business rules:

    Domain Allowed       Email Addresses
    com-en (English)     .org.uk, co.uk, .biz    
	com-br (Brazilean)   .org.br, .info
	com-es (Spanish)     .acrede-es, .acrede

- The repository to store user data is an xml data store that will be 
replaced in the next 6 â€“ 12 months by a database. Therefore we 
should be able to seamlessly switch from one data source to another at 
some point in the future. Please take this into account when designing 
the solution. (In case you find XML tough you can use HSQL).

- You may wish to implement a front-end design of your choice.

- The application needs to be well-architected, robust, scalable and secure.

### 2. Note

We value quality over quantity - this is intended to be a gauge of your 
development approach, so prioritise carefully.
