Create an application to provide an anagram game, similar to the TV show Countdown.

The game is constructed with a random set of base letters a to z, e.g. the string "areallylongword". The player then attempts to create words out of the letters, and scores one point for each letter used. Letters cannot be used more than once. Whether or not the submission is a word should be checked by loading the word list found here: http://www.xxx.com/codetest/wordlist.txt and confirming that the submitted word is in the list. For example, when starting with the base string "areallylongword": 

- "no" is an acceptable submission, with score 2
- "grow" is an acceptable submission, with score 4
- "bold" is not an acceptable submission
- "glly" is not an acceptable submission
- "woolly" is an acceptable submission with score 6
- "adder" is not an acceptable submission

The game should maintain in memory a list of the top ten highest-scoring submissions (word and score). Throughout this test, you need not worry about whitespace, special characters, or uppercase: you may assume that both the original string of letters and all submissions contain none of these.

There is no need to make a user interface: it is sufficient to implement the interface described in pseudo-Java below. If any of the instructions are unclear, make a reasonable assumption and document it with a comment.


    interface AnagramGame {

        /**
         * Submit a word on behalf of a user. A word is accepted if its letters are
         * contained in the original string submitted in the constructor, and if it
         * is in the word list at http://www.xxx.com/codetest/wordlist.txt.
         * If the word is accepted and its score is high enough, the submission
         * should be added to the high score list. If there are multiple submissions
         * with the same score, all are accepted, but the first submission with that
         * score should rank higher.
         *
         * @parameter word User's submission. All submissions may be assumed to be
         *             lowercase and containing no whitespace or special
         *             characters.
         */
        submitWord(string word);

        /**
         * Return word entry at given position in the high score list, 0 being the
         * highest (best score) and 9 the lowest. You may assume that this method
